Main Objective: Create a repository of Online Gender-Based Violence (OGBV) lexicons tailored to African languages and contexts to improve the detection and understanding of online violence.
Implementation method: An AI-based lexicon generation and update system

setup a virtual environment for the project: python -m venv venv
activate the virtual environment: cd venv/Scripts then ./activate
get back to root folder using cd .. (twice)

1.  ogbv_scraper
    This folder contains a scraper tool done using scrapy

         ogbv_scraper\ogbv_scraper\spiders\ogbv_spider.py - The main scraper directory

         in it, one can input the website he desires to scrape then runs the command: scrapy crawl ogbv

         a file will then be generated and copied one directory back for analysis

         on the command line run python gpt_analysis.py
         This will produce another json file with the analysis done showing of the nature of sentence (if it gender based violent sentence)

         For the case of this project, preference is put on african website, post, blogs

2.  ogbv_monitoring
    This folder contains django project encompassing django templating engine

        in this social media accounts (instagram, X, and facebook) are monitored
        Analysis is given on the conversation that entails onine gender based violence and in addition to the openai,  #hashtags are used in identification

        Using this, one needs to have four API access keys in order to be successful with it.

        check on the developer portal for the API keys and make sure you get the right ones, for example facebook required the users key and not normal access key that is explicit on their site
